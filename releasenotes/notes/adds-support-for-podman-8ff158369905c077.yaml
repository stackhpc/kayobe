issues:
  - |
    On Ubuntu 22.04, when using podman, containers may get stuck in the
    ``creating`` state when using a ``6.5.x`` series (or newer) kernel. See
    `LP#2056210
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ansible-collection-kolla/+bug/2056210>`__ for
    more details. The bug has been fixed upstream in crun, but we are awaiting
    a new Ubuntu 22.04 package to be released.
