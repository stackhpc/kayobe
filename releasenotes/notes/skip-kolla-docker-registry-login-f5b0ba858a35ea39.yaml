    Attempts to log in to the kolla docker registry can be skipped by setting
    ``deploy_containers_registry_attempt_login`` to false.

    This is required for deployments using a non-standard registry
    deployed on the seed during the deploy-container step, since it takes
    place after the registry login attempt.
