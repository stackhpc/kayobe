    Adds an introspection rule to update the location of the deployment kernel
    registered in existing Ironic nodes. Nodes discovered on a deployment
    running the Train release or earlier may still be using the ``ipa.vmlinuz``
    kernel, which stays unchanged when deployment images get updated. If only
    default introspection rules are in use, existing nodes may be updated from
    the Bifrost container with the following command:

    ``OS_CLOUD=bifrost baremetal introspection reprocess $NODE_UUID_OR_NAME``

    If non-default rules are used, reprocessing may revert any customisation
    done by the operator. In this case, a more cautious approach is to update
    the deployment kernel location manually:

    ``OS_CLOUD=bifrost baremetal node set --driver-info deploy_kernel=<http://url/to/ipa.kernel> $NODE_UUID_OR_NAME``

    If the ``kolla_bifrost_inspector_rules`` list is customised, the rule
    ``inspector_rule_legacy_deploy_kernel`` should be added to it.
