    Adds the internal VIP to the NOPROXY/noproxy environment variables.
security:

    When running API requests from a host configured with kayobe, traffic
    destined for the internal VIP is sent via the default proxy. This can be a
    security issue if not using TLS as the proxy will be able to intercept the
    traffic. If using an untrusted proxy, with TLS disabled on the internal
    VIP, it is recommended that you run ``kayobe overcloud host configure -t
    proxy``, ``kayobe seed hypervisor host configure -t proxy``, ``kayobe seed
    host configure -t proxy``, and ``kayobe infra vm host configure -t proxy``,
    to add the internal VIP to the no proxy configuration. This is considered a
    minor issue as traffic between containers will not use the proxy by
    default.
