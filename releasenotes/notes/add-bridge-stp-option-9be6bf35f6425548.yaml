features:
  - |
    The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) can now be configured on bridge interfaces.
    Enable or disable STP by setting the ``bridge_stp`` attribute for a network.
    Note that STP is not set by default on Ubuntu, but it is disabled on Rocky
    Linux 9 for compatibility with network scripts, as NetworkManager enables
    STP on all bridges by default.
upgrade:
  - |
    For Rocky Linux 9, Kayobe now disables STP on a bridge by default. This
    action will cause the bridge interface to restart during the host
    configuration process.
