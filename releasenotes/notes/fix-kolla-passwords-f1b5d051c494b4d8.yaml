    Fixes an issue where generation of ``passwords.yml`` for Kolla Ansible
    could fail if the directory containing the file does not exist. This is
    typical in a multiple environment setup, when creating a new environment.
    See `story 2010293 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2010293>`_
    for details.
