deprecates:
  - |
    Renames ``kolla_external_fqdn_cacert`` to ``kolla_public_openrc_cacert``
    and ``kolla_internal_fqdn_cacert`` to ``kolla_admin_openrc_cacert``. This
    matches the Kolla Ansible variable name and better reflects their purpose.
    The old variable names are still supported until the end of the deprecation
    period (2024.2 "D" series release or later).
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes an issue where the Kolla Ansible variable
    ``kolla_admin_openrc_cacert`` was not set to the value of
    ``kolla_internal_fqdn_cacert``.
