    The `kolla_base_arch` variable has been introduced, allowing users
    to specify the architecture for base container images. This supports
    cross-architecture builds, enabling the building of images for
    architectures different from the host machine (e.g., building
    `aarch64` images on an `x86_64` machine).

    By default, `kolla_base_arch` is set to the detected architecture
    (`{{ ansible_facts.architecture }}`). However, when `kolla_base_arch`
    differs from the host architecture, the `multiarch/qemu-user-static`
    image is used to facilitate cross-arch builds.
