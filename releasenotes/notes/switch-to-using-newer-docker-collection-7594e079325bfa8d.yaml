fixes:
  - |
    Switches to using ``ansible-core`` based kolla-ansible install.  This is a
    workaround for `LP#2072979
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kayobe/+bug/2072979>`__, but also results in a
    lighter weight install.
  - |
    Switches to using a newer version of the docker community collection to
    workaround issues using the docker ansible modules with certain
    combinations of python libraries. See `LP#2072979
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kayobe/+bug/2072979>`__.
