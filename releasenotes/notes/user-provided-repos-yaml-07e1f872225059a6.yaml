    Since Kolla containers can built with user provided ``repos.yaml`` Kayobe
    can override the file with their own content. The override files can be
    ``${KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH}/kolla/repos.yaml`` (default Kolla filename) or
    ``${KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH}/kolla/repos.yml``. Multiple Environments supported.
