deprecations:
  - |
    Support for the ``devicemapper`` Docker storage driver is deprecated
    following its removal from Docker Engine 25.0. Support will be fully
    removed in the Caracal 16.0.0 release. Operators using ``devicemapper``
    should ensure that a compatible version of Docker Engine is installed (i.e.
    release 24.x or below).
