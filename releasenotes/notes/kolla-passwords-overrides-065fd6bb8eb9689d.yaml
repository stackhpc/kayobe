    Fixes an issue when user forgot to combine
    ``kolla_ansible_custom_passwords``,
    ``kolla_ansible_default_custom_passwords`` and own dictionary with custom
    passwords in configuration files. Now
    ``kolla_ansible_extra_custom_passwords`` should provide only user custom
    passwords to add or override in the passwords.yml.
upgrade:
  - |
    Now no need to combine ``kolla_ansible_default_custom_passwords`` and
    ``kolla_ansible_custom_passwords`` in your custom configuration. Just use
    ``kolla_ansible_extra_custom_passwords`` to add or override passwords.
