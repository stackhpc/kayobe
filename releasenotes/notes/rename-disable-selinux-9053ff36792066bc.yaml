    Adds functionality to configure desired SELinux state (in addition to
    disabling SELinux previously).
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``disable-selinux`` role has been renamed to ``selinux`` and so have
    been the related variables. If you set one of them, adapt your
    configuration:

    * ``disable_selinux_do_reboot`` becomes ``selinux_do_reboot``
    * ``disable_selinux_reboot_timeout`` becomes ``selinux_reboot_timeout``
  - |
     Kayobe still sets SELinux to ``disabled`` by default, unlike in the Zed
     13.0.0 release. Operators may want to set ``selinux_state`` to
     ``permissive`` to avoid another reboot in the Zed upgrade.
