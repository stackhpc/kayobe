    When determining whether or not a host needs bootstrapping, we attempt to
    connect to the host using ``ansible_user``, if the login fails, we then
    assume that the host needs bootstrapping. In previous releases we used a
    manually crafted ``ssh`` command. This did not respect any customisations
    to the SSH arguments made through Ansible configuration. We now use the raw
    module so that these customisations are used when connecting to the host.
    One possible use case is to configure a jump host between the control host
    and the target hosts. If bootstrapping was needed, hosts will now show as
    unreachable in the summary stats at the end of the run. This can safely be
    ignored.
